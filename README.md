# Full Stack Frameworks Milestone Project - Unicorn Attractor App

![UA](https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/full-stack-frameworks/ua.PNG)

The unicorn attractor is a modern startup venture.
The business model for this app centers loosely around the idea of an online, open source community contributing capital and ideas to its development. 
The unicorn attractor offers software development services and bug fixes for free, but a small fee from any user requesting an additional feature on the site. 
The applications primary means of collecting user information is in the form of issue/work tickets, not too dissimilar to what you might find in a modern CRM. 
Each ticket displays one of three different status'; assigned, in progress or completed. 
Issues or tickets are logged to two different categories; bugs/defects in the application which will be fixed for free, and feature additions which will only be implemented for a chargeable fee. 

The application facilitates the prioritisation of different tasks for the administrator, by implementing a mechanism for the user to 'up-vote' both bug fixes and feature additions. 
Upvoting bug fixes does not cost any money, but the addition of a new feature to the site, which requires a certain number of upvotes to be implemented, requires a small fee to cover labour costs. 
In return, the site administrator will pledge to spend a minimum amount of time working on the most popular voted highest-paid feature addition request. 

## UX
 
This app is targeted towards the open source developer community. It is meant as a means for people to come together in an online community to discuss and share their ideas. As a start-up company project, the intention is to allow the user to have an input into the design of the web app, by allowing the facility for features requests to be voted upon/developed. 
###	User Stories:
-	As an open source developer, I am looking for a place to collaborate and share my ideas in relation to software development. 
-	My aim is to be able to learn from others and develop my skills to become a better developer. 
-	I need to be able to login to an app where I can use a commenting system to discuss features and bugs with other developers.

## Features

## Existing Features

### Registration: 

New users are provided with a means to register on the site. Access to any of the sites functionality requires that the user be registered. Registration is handled by the accounts app, it uses the Django auth model. Django forms handle the user input and form. 

- Login: Login functionality is handled by the accounts app. This allows a user who has already registered on the site to login and access the sites functionality. A user can login using a combination of either their username and password or email address and password.  
- Index: Once the user has logged in they will be redirected to the index.html page. Here the user will be greeted with a jumbotron containing their own login username and a welcome message. This page contains information about the sites goals and usage, as well as displaying the navbar functionality for the first time. The navbar functionality is available on all pages if the user has successfully logged in. 
- Tickets Functionality: To add a feature request or register a bug on the site, the user can navigate to the user profile page using three different methods; the About icon contained in the navbar, the unicorn icon also contained in the navbar, or by following the instructions contained on the index page. Once the user has successfully navigated to the /tickets/ page, they can select from “Report a Bug” or “Log Feature Request” options. 

### Navbar:

- Bugs: When the user selects the Bugs option on the navbar, they are redirected to the /bugs/ url. Here they will see a list of bugs retrieved from the database that have already been added in the database by any other user. The bug ticket will show its ticket status, number of views, creation date and number of likes or “up-votes”. The user can click on the title of the bug to be transferred to the /bug_detail/ url. Here the user will be free to comment on the issue, and edit the bug specific information: description, title and status. 
- Features: When the user selects the Features option on the navbar, they are redirected to the /features/ url. Here they will see a list of features retrieved from the database that have already been added in the database by any other user. The feature ticket will show its ticket status, number of views, creation date and number of likes or “up-votes”. The user can click on the title of the feature to be transferred to the /feature_detail/ url. Here the user will be free to comment on the issue, and edit the bug specific information: description, title and status. The user will also have the option to “Upvote” the feature request, to signify their interest in having the feature implemented in the web app. Upon clicking the upvote button, the user will be redirected to the /view_cart/ url, where they will be presented with the number of items added to the users cart, and the total cost of all items. The user will have the option to “Go To Checkout”. The user can access the /view_cart/ url from the navbar, so long as their cart contains at least one item. 
- Checkout: The /checkout/ url displays a Django payment form allowing the user to pay for items in their cart. The form is implemented using the stripe API integration. On this page, the user will be presented with the number of items being purchased and the total cost. Once payment has been successfully completed, the user will observe a Django messages success message, notifying them that the payment has completed with success. 
- Profile: Users can access a rudimentary profile page from the navbar. Here they will be presented with a means of logging a ticket via the /tickets/ url, as well as confirmation of their user login ID. 
- Stats: Users can access the sites usage data graph using the /stats/ url. Here they will see content pertaining to the number of bugs, features, users and comments contained within the database. This was implemented using Django REST framework and Chart.js. 

### Features Left to Implement

- User Profile: Additionally, I would like to extend the default Django auth model to allow users to input extra information upon registration, Bio, Location, Occupation etc. I would also like to include functionality to upload a user profile picture in the same update. 

## Technologies Used

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) Version control for this app was managed using Git, with a remote public repository hosted on Github: [github](https://github.com/bransfieldjack/fullstack-frameworks-milestone-project-unicorn-attractor/tree/master)
- [Python 3 ](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) Python was chosen as it is delivered on the course content. It is easy to use, modern and versatile. 
- [Django==1.11 (LTS) ](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/) Django 1.11 long term support was used for the sites framework. This is the version used throughout the tutorials during the course and support for this iteration extends beyond 2018.
- [Django REST framework ](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) Django REST framework was used to construct the web API for use with the sites stats page. The endpoints can be accessed via JQuery and provide data input for the Chart.js plugin. The browseable API can be accessed via the following link once logged into the site: https://unicorn-attractor-jackalack117.c9users.io/ChartData/.
- [JQuery 3.3.1 ](https://blog.jquery.com/2018/01/20/jquery-3-3-1-fixed-dependencies-in-release-tag/) JQuery 3.3.1 was used for both the styling and to assist with the AJAX calls used on this site. 3.3.1was used as it resolved an issue discovered in the previous release. 
- [Bootstrap 4.1.3 ](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/download/) Bootstrap 4 was used for this sites style templating. Bootstrap 4 is the newest and fastest version of bootstrap. 
- [AWS SDK for Python (Boto) ](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/) Boto is a library used to access AWS S3, EC2, and DynamoDB services. I used it in conjunction with an S3 bucket to host the static files required for this site. 
- [AWS S3 ](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) AWS S3 Bucket storage was used to host static files. This can be accessed programmatically from our app using boto and secretkey environment variables. 
- [Stripe ](https://stripe.com/au) The sites online payment functionality has been implemente using Stripe. The stripe API allows us to process payments on the site which are dealt with by 3rd party banks/financial companies. 
- [Gunicorn 19.9.0 ](http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/news.html) Gunicorn is a python WSGI used for deployment of the application on Heroku. 
- [Psycopg2==2.7.6.1 ](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/) Psycopg2 is a Postgresql adaptor/driver used for deployment of the sites database on Heroku.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/products) Heroku is a managed, container-based cloud (PaaS) platform as a service. Heroku was a clear choice in terms of deployment platform given its integration with modern technologies. 
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) Wirefaming was completed using Balsamiq. This was helpful during the UX design process. 

* All of the code written in this project is my own, with the exception of the stripe.js file for interacting with the stripe API and the Chart.js code in the Django-Charts app for interacting with the Django REST framework end points.

## Testing

This project was created using a TDD approach where possible. Unit testing was conducted as much and as frequently as possible. For test cases where the unit test framework could not be applied to the work, a separate test_app.py file was used to test standalone python functions. The purpose of unit testing with python is to recognise bugs/issues with the code early in the development process.

## Manual Testing

### Linking/pages:

Checked all outgoing (page to page) and internal links.
Confirmed that no orphan pages exist as part of this project. (Un-used pages left over from the development process)

### Form Testing:

Tested form submission links and form validation for image upload - no issues.

### Cookies Testing:

Disabled cookies and confirmed that the site behaves as per normal.
No observable effect on application security after disabling cookies during or outside of a session.

### HTML Validation:

Validated all HTML code using: https://validator.w3.org/ (Fixed minor errors/warnings)

### Database Testing:

Verified that test data was writing to the mongoDB database. 
Verified the ability to retrieve data from the same database.

### Ease of Learning:

Everything the user needs in terms of information is clearly displayed. Clickable links are made obvious when appropriate, and large icons are used for clarity.

### Navigation:

The site is relatively easy to navigate. 
The user cannot progress throughout the site without entering a username. 

### Compatibility:

Cross browser compatibility testing has been conducted using Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Opera.
Mobile compatibility testing has been undertaken to ensure that the site works well on mobile devices. 


In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
